    <h2>“Would you eat them in a box? Would you eat them with a fox?” said Sam-I-Am</h2>
    <p>The famous dish from Dr. Seuss's Green Eggs and Ham. A fine delicacy to be served only on special occasions, or not at all.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     <ul>
        <li>Baked ham</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Green food coloring</li>
        <li>Cooking oil</li>
     </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Submerge ham in a pot of water mixed with green food coloring. Wait around 30 minutes for the ham to soak up the color.</li>
        <li>Crack your eggs and separate the yolks into a different container. Then pour some green food coloring into the yolks container and wait until it soaks up the color.</li>
        <li>Heat a pan with some oil, pour a bit of the egg white and lay one of the yolks on top. When it's cooked to your liking, serve it on a plate.</li>
        <li>As for the ham, when it's already soaked up the color, place it in the oven at 350 degrees for around 10 minutes just to warm it up. Once this is done, remove the ham from the oven and serve it with your eggs.</li>
    </ol>
